# Unit 1 â€“ Command-Based Questions (5)

Instructions: For each scenario, write the exact Git (and shell, if needed) commands you would run, in order. Use only Unit 1 topics (installation/config, basic commands, and workflow).

---

1) Initialize and First Commit
- Create a new project folder called `codingGita-journal`, move into it, initialize Git, create a file `README.md` with the title `# My codingGita Learning Journey`, stage it, and make your first commit with the message: `Created initial README`.


3) Selective Staging and Commit
- You edited three files: `README.md`, `style.css`, and `script.js`. Stage only `README.md` and `style.css` (leave `script.js` unstaged), verify with status, and commit with the message: `Update docs and styles`.

4) Inspect History and Last Changes
- Show a compact, one-line list of recent commits.
- Then display the exact changes introduced by the most recent commit.

5) Compare and Review Changes
- You have modified `style.css` but have not staged it yet. Show the unstaged changes for just `style.css`.
- Then stage `style.css` and show the diff of staged changes only.
