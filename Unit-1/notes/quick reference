git add *.txt              # Stage all .txt files
```

**Save Changes:**
```bash
git commit -m "Message"    # Save with message
git commit -am "Message"   # Add and commit modified files
```

**View History:**
```bash
git log                    # Full history
git log --oneline          # Compact history
git log -5                 # Last 5 commits
git show HEAD              # Show last commit details
```

### Working with Files

**See Changes:**
```bash
git diff                   # See unstaged changes
git diff --staged          # See staged changes
git diff HEAD~1            # Compare with previous commit
```

**File Management:**
```bash
git mv oldname.txt newname.txt    # Rename file
git rm filename.txt               # Remove file
git restore filename.txt          # Undo changes to file
```

**Project Structure:**
```bash
# On Windows:
dir                         # List files
tree /f                     # Show folder structure

# On macOS/Linux:

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Problems

### Problem 1: "Git is not recognized"

**Symptoms:**
```bash
'git' is not recognized as an internal or external command
```

**Solution:**
1. **Windows:** Install Git from https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. **macOS:** Install with Homebrew: `brew install git`
3. **Linux:** Install with package manager: `sudo apt install git`

**Verify Installation:**
```bash
git --version
```

### Problem 2: "Please tell me who you are"

**Symptoms:**
```bash
*** Please tell me who you are.

Run

  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

**Solution:**
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@college.edu"
```

### Problem 3: "Nothing to commit, working tree clean"

**Symptoms:**
```bash
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

**What This Means:**
- All your changes are already saved
- No new files to commit
- This is actually good news!

**To Check:**
```bash
git status                 # Should show "clean"
git log --oneline          # Should show your commits
```

### Problem 4: "Changes not staged for commit"

**Symptoms:**
```bash
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
        modified:   README.md
```

**Solution:**
```bash
git add README.md          # Stage the file
git commit -m "Updated README"  # Save changes
```

### Problem 5: "Already up to date"

**Symptoms:**
```bash
Already up to date.
```

**What This Means:**
- Your local project is current
- No new changes to pull
- This is normal and good!

### Problem 6: "Permission denied"

**Symptoms:**
```bash
Permission denied (publickey).
```

**Solution:**
- This usually happens with GitHub (we'll learn this later)
- For now, focus on local Git commands
- This error won't affect your local projects

## üìù Best Practices for First-Year Students

### 1. Commit Frequently
**Good:**
```bash
git commit -m "Added user login form"
git commit -m "Fixed button styling"
git commit -m "Updated project documentation"
```

**Bad:**
```bash
git commit -m "stuff"
git commit -m "changes"
git commit -m "fixed things"
```

### 2. Use Descriptive Messages
**Good:**
```bash
git commit -m "Added navigation menu to codingGita homepage"
git commit -m "Fixed bug where user couldn't save their progress"
git commit -m "Updated CSS to match college branding guidelines"
```

**Bad:**
```bash
git commit -m "w"
git commit -m "."
git commit -m "asdf"
```

### 3. Check Status Before Committing
**Always do this:**
```bash
git status              # See what's happening
git add .               # Stage changes
git status              # Verify what's staged
git commit -m "Message" # Save changes
```

### 4. Organize Your Projects
**Good Structure:**
```
my-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # Project description
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ css/               # Styling files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js/                # JavaScript files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/            # Project images
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/              # Documentation
```

**Bad Structure:**
```
my-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ file1.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ file2.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ file3.txt
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ file4.txt
```

## üö® Emergency Commands (When Things Go Wrong)

### Undo Last Commit (But Keep Changes)
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

**What This Does:**
- Removes the last commit
- Keeps your changes staged
- Like "un-submitting" your assignment but keeping your work

### Undo Last Commit (Lose Changes)
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** This permanently deletes your last commit and changes!

### Discard All Unstaged Changes
```bash
git restore .
```

**What This Does:**
- Undoes all unsaved changes
- Returns files to last committed state
- Like "reverting" your document to last saved version

### See What You're About to Lose
```bash
git status              # See what's changed
git diff                # See exact changes
```

**Always check before using destructive commands!**

## üìä Understanding Git Output

### Git Status Colors
- **Red text** = Changes not staged (need `git add`)
- **Green text** = Changes staged (ready to commit)
- **No color** = Everything is saved

### Git Log Format
```bash
commit abc1234 (HEAD -> main)
Author: Your Name <your.email@college.edu>
Date:   Mon Dec 4 14:30:25 2023 +0530

    Your commit message here
```

**What Each Part Means:**
- `commit abc1234` = Unique ID for this save
- `(HEAD -> main)` = Current position in history
- `Author` = Who made the change
- `Date` = When it was saved
- `Message` = What you wrote about the change

### Git Diff Symbols
```bash
- old line that was removed
+ new line that was added
```

## üîç Common Scenarios and Solutions

### Scenario 1: "I made changes but forgot to commit"

git status

# Stage and save:
git add .
git commit -m "Saved my work before leaving"
```

### Scenario 2: "I want to see what I changed yesterday"

git restore filename.txt

# Or restore from specific commit:
git restore --source=HEAD filename.txt
```

### Scenario 4: "I want to see my project's history"
