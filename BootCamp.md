# ⚡ One-Day Intensive: AI-Powered Full-Stack Bootcamp
## Building Modern Web Applications with Trae, Cursor, and DeepSeek

This plan outlines a high-intensity, one-day bootcamp designed to take learners from an initial idea to a functional full-stack application using cutting-edge AI code editors and the DeepSeek AI engine.

---

### 🎯 Bootcamp Objective
To demonstrate the power of **AI-First Development**. Participants will learn to use AI editors (**Trae/Cursor**) to scaffold, build, and deploy a "SoloLearn" clone in a single day, transitioning from frontend prototypes to a database-backed system.

### 🕒 Bootcamp Schedule (One-Day Intensive)

| Time | Session | Key Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **10:00 - 10:30** | **Session 0: AI Ideation** | Brainstorming project ideas & features with AI |
| **10:30 - 12:15** | **Phase 1: Wibe Coding - Frontend** | Building the SoloLearn UI live with AI (Trae/Cursor) |
| **12:15 - 13:15** | **Break** | - |
| **13:15 - 16:00** | **Phase 2: Wibe Coding - Full Stack** | Node.js, MongoDB & API development live with AI |

### 🧠 The Focus: Wibe Coding with AI
The core of this bootcamp is **Wibe Coding** (Live AI-Driven Coding). Instead of traditional manual typing, we focus on:
- **Directing AI in Real-Time:** Using Trae/Cursor to write entire modules through expert prompting.
- **Thinking with AI:** Explaining the *why* behind AI-generated code as it appears on screen.
- **Rapid Iteration:** Instantly refactoring and debugging logic through live interaction with DeepSeek.

### 🏗️ Project: "LearnFlow" (SoloLearn Clone)
A bite-sized learning platform featuring interactive lessons, progress tracking, and user quizzes.

#### **Step 0: AI Ideation (10:00 - 10:30)**
- Using AI to brainstorm features and define the "Minimum Viable Product" (MVP).
- Generating a technical roadmap and component hierarchy.
- **Outcome:** A clear blueprint for the day.

#### **🚀 Phase 1: Wibe Coding - Frontend (10:30 - 12:15)**
*Goal: Build a high-fidelity interactive UI live using AI prompting.*
- **UI Scaffolding:** Using Trae/Cursor to generate a responsive dashboard and course cards.
- **Interactive Quiz Engine:** Prompting the AI to build the logic for multiple-choice questions, state management, and score calculation.
- **Local Data Handling:** Storing user progress in `localStorage` and fetching content from a local JSON file.
- **Outcome:** A fully functional, interactive frontend prototype.

#### **🔐 Phase 2: Wibe Coding - Full Stack (13:15 - 16:00)**
*Goal: Move from local state to a persistent, secure backend live with AI.*
- **Backend Setup:** Prompting AI to scaffold a Node.js/Express server.
- **Database Integration:** Connecting to MongoDB for persistent storage of users and quiz results.
- **API Development:** Using AI to generate RESTful endpoints for user authentication (JWT) and course data.
- **Frontend-to-Backend Sync:** Replacing local JSON mocks with real API calls.
- **Outcome:** A production-ready full-stack application.

### 🎓 Learning Outcomes for Higher Authorities
By the end of this one-day bootcamp, participants will:
1.  **Master AI-First Workflows:** Shift from "writing code" to "directing AI" to build complex systems faster.
2.  **Rapid Prototyping Skills:** Learn how to create high-quality frontends in hours instead of days.
3.  **Architectural Understanding:** Gain hands-on experience in connecting modern frontends (React) with scalable backends (Node/Mongo).
4.  **Production Readiness:** Understand the path from a local idea to a deployed, secure application.
