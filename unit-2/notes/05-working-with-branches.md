# Topic 5: Creating and Working with Branches

## 📚 Theory

### What are Git Branches?
**Git branches** are like **parallel timelines** of your project. Each branch represents a different version or feature of your code. Think of them as **different storylines** in the same book - they can develop independently and then come together.

#### 🏠 Hostel Analogy
- **Main branch** = Your main hostel room (stable, working version)
- **Feature branch** = A temporary room where you experiment with new furniture
- **Switching branches** = Moving between rooms to work on different things
- **Merging** = Moving the best furniture from experiment room to main room

#### 💻 Coding Analogy
```
Your Project Branches:
main:           A──B──C (stable version)
feature/login:      └──D──E (login feature)
feature/design:      └──F──G (new design)
hotfix/bug:         └──H (urgent fix)
```

## 🚀 Creating and Managing Branches

### 1. **Creating New Branches**

#### Method 1: Create and Switch in One Command
```bash
# Create new branch and switch to it immediately
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication

# This is equivalent to:
# git branch feature/user-authentication
# git checkout feature/user-authentication
```

#### Method 2: Create Branch from Specific Commit
```bash
# Create branch from a specific commit
git checkout -b feature/old-version HEAD~3

# Create branch from a specific commit hash
git checkout -b feature/from-commit a1b2c3d4
```

#### Method 3: Create Branch from Another Branch
```bash
# Make sure you're on the source branch
git checkout main

# Create new branch from main
git checkout -b feature/new-feature main
```

### 2. **Branch Naming Conventions**

#### ✅ **Good Branch Names**
```bash
# Feature branches
git checkout -b feature/user-login
git checkout -b feature/calculator-functions
git checkout -b feature/mobile-responsive-design

# Bug fix branches
git checkout -b fix/login-button-issue
git checkout -b fix/mobile-layout-bug
git checkout -b hotfix/security-vulnerability

# Release branches
git checkout -b release/v1.0.0
git checkout -b release/v2.0.0
```

#### ❌ **Bad Branch Names**
```bash
# Too generic
git checkout -b new
git checkout -b test
git checkout -b update

# Too long
git checkout -b feature/this-is-a-very-long-branch-name-that-is-hard-to-read

# No prefix
git checkout -b user-login
git checkout -b bug-fix
```

### 3. **Viewing Branches**

#### List All Branches
```bash
# List local branches
git branch

# List all branches (local and remote)
git branch -a

# List remote branches only
git branch -r

# List branches with more details
git branch -v
```

#### Branch Information
```bash
# Show current branch
git branch --show-current

# Show branch with last commit
git branch -v

# Show merged/unmerged branches
git branch --merged
git branch --no-merged
```

## 🔄 Working with Multiple Branches

### 1. **Switching Between Branches**

#### Basic Branch Switching
```bash
# Switch to existing branch
git checkout feature/user-login

# Switch back to main
git checkout main

# Switch to previous branch
git checkout -
```

#### Modern Git Commands (Git 2.23+)
```bash
# Switch to branch (newer syntax)
git switch feature/user-login

# Switch back to main
git switch main

# Switch to previous branch
git switch -
```

### 2. **Working on Multiple Features**

#### Scenario: Working on Login and Calculator
```bash
# Start on main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create and work on login feature
git checkout -b feature/user-login
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add user login form"
git push origin feature/user-login

# Switch to calculator feature
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/calculator
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add basic calculator functions"
git push origin feature/calculator

# Switch back to login to continue work
git checkout feature/user-login
# ... continue working ...
```

### 3. **Branch Synchronization**

#### Keeping Branches Updated
```bash
# Update main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Update your feature branch with latest main
git checkout feature/user-login
git merge main

# Or use rebase (alternative to merge)
git rebase main
```

#### Pushing and Pulling Branches
```bash
# Push new branch to GitHub
git push -u origin feature/user-login

# Push updates to existing branch
git push origin feature/user-login

# Pull updates from remote branch
git pull origin feature/user-login
```

## 🌐 GitHub Branch Management

### 1. **Creating Branches on GitHub**

#### Web Interface Method
1. **Go to your repository** on GitHub
2. **Click the branch dropdown** (shows current branch)
3. **Type new branch name** in the search box
4. **Click "Create branch: [name] from [source]"**

#### Command Line Method (Recommended)
```bash
# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add new feature"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin feature/new-feature
```

### 2. **Branch Protection Rules**

#### Setting Up Protection
1. **Go to repository Settings**
2. **Click "Branches"** in left sidebar
3. **Click "Add rule"**
4. **Configure protection**:
   - **Branch name pattern**: `main` or `main*`
   - **Require pull request reviews**: ✓
   - **Require status checks**: ✓
   - **Restrict pushes**: ✓

#### Benefits of Protection
- **Prevents direct commits** to main
- **Requires code review** before merging
- **Ensures tests pass** before merging
- **Maintains code quality**

### 3. **Branch Visualization on GitHub**

#### Network Graph
- **Go to repository** on GitHub
- **Click "Insights"** tab
- **Click "Network"** in left sidebar
- **Shows**: Branch structure and commit history

#### Branch Comparison
- **Go to repository** on GitHub
- **Click "Compare & pull request"**
- **Choose base and compare branches**
- **See differences** between branches

## 🔧 Real-Life Examples

### Example 1: College Project Development
```
Repository: college-calculator-app
Team: 3 students

Branching Strategy:
main: Stable calculator (always working)
├── feature/basic-math (Student A)
├── feature/scientific-functions (Student B)
└── feature/mobile-design (Student C)

Workflow:
1. Each student creates their feature branch
2. Work independently on their features
3. Regularly sync with main branch
4. Create pull requests when ready
5. Merge features one by one
```

### Example 2: Personal Website Development
```
Repository: my-portfolio
Strategy: Feature-based development

Branches:
main: Live portfolio (always functional)
├── feature/about-page
├── feature/projects-showcase
├── feature/contact-form
└── feature/blog-section

Benefits:
- Can work on multiple sections
- Each feature is isolated
- Easy to test individual features
- Portfolio stays live
```

### Example 3: Bug Fix Workflow
```
Problem: Critical bug in production
Solution: Hotfix branch

Workflow:
1. Create hotfix branch from main
   git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug-fix

2. Fix the bug quickly
   # ... make minimal changes ...

3. Test the fix
   # ... verify fix works ...

4. Merge to main and delete hotfix
   git checkout main
   git merge hotfix/critical-bug-fix
   git branch -d hotfix/critical-bug-fix
```

## 🚧 Common Mistakes & Solutions

### Mistake 1: "I forgot to create a branch and committed to main"
```bash
# Problem: Committed directly to main
# Solution: Move commit to feature branch

# Create branch from current state
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# Reset main to previous commit
git checkout main
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Now work on your feature branch
git checkout feature/my-feature
```

### Mistake 2: "My branch is out of sync with main"
```bash
# Problem: Feature branch is behind main
# Solution: Update feature branch

# Method 1: Merge main into feature
git checkout feature/my-feature
git merge main

# Method 2: Rebase feature on main (cleaner history)
git checkout feature/my-feature
git rebase main
```

### Mistake 3: "I can't push my branch to GitHub"
```bash
# Problem: Branch doesn't exist on GitHub
# Solution: Set upstream and push

# First time pushing new branch
git push -u origin feature/my-feature

# Subsequent pushes
git push origin feature/my-feature
```

### Mistake 4: "I want to rename my branch"
```bash
# Problem: Need to rename branch
# Solution: Rename local and remote

# Rename local branch
git branch -m feature/old-name feature/new-name

# Delete old remote branch
git push origin --delete feature/old-name

# Push new branch
git push -u origin feature/new-name
```
