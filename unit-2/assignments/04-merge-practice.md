---

## ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

```bash
# Make sure you're in your learning journal repository
cd codinggita-learning-journal

# Check current status
git status

# Should show: "working tree clean"

# Check current branch
git branch --show-current

# Should show: main

# View all branches
git branch -a

# Should show: main, feature/portfolio-website, feature/weather-app
```

### Step 2: Update Main Branch

```bash
# Make sure main branch is up to date
git pull origin main

# Check if there are any new changes
git log --oneline -5
```

### Step 3: Merge Portfolio Website Branch

```bash
# Switch to main branch (if not already there)
git checkout main

# Merge the portfolio feature branch
git merge feature/portfolio-website

# Git will show merge information
# Should show: "Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy"
```

### Step 4: Verify Portfolio Merge

```bash
# Check what files are now in main
ls src/

# Should show: calculator.html, portfolio.html

# Check the merge commit
git log --oneline -3

# Should show the merge commit
```

### Step 5: Test Portfolio Website

```bash
# Open the portfolio website in your browser
# Navigate to: file:///path/to/your/repository/src/portfolio.html

# Test the functionality:
# 1. Check if the page loads correctly
# 2. Verify the styling is applied
# 3. Test the navigation links
# 4. Ensure responsive design works
```

### Step 6: Merge Weather App Branch

```bash
# Stay on main branch
git checkout main

# Merge the weather app feature branch
git merge feature/weather-app

# Git will show merge information
# Should show: "Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy"
```

### Step 7: Verify Weather App Merge

```bash
# Check what files are now in main
ls src/

# Should show: calculator.html, portfolio.html, weather.html

# Check the merge commits
git log --oneline -5

# Should show both merge commits
```

### Step 8: Test Weather App

```bash
# Open the weather app in your browser
# Navigate to: file:///path/to/your/repository/src/weather.html

# Test the functionality:
# 1. Check if the page loads correctly
# 2. Verify the styling is applied
# 3. Test the search interface
# 4. Ensure responsive design works
```

### Step 9: View Merge History

```bash
# View the complete branch structure
git log --graph --oneline --all

# This will show how the branches were merged
# You should see a clear merge pattern
```

### Step 10: Clean Up Merged Branches

```bash
# Check which branches have been merged
git branch --merged

# Should show: feature/portfolio-website, feature/weather-app

# Delete the merged feature branches locally
git branch -d feature/portfolio-website
git branch -d feature/weather-app

# Verify branches are deleted
git branch

# Should show only: main
```

### Step 11: Clean Up Remote Branches

```bash
# Delete the remote feature branches
git push origin --delete feature/portfolio-website
git push origin --delete feature/weather-app

# Clean up local remote references
git fetch --prune

# Verify remote branches are cleaned up
git branch -r
```

### Step 12: Push Updated Main Branch

```bash
# Push the updated main branch to GitHub
git push origin main

# Verify the push was successful
git status
```

### Step 13: Test Complete Project

```bash
# Test all three projects:
# 1. Calculator: file:///path/to/your/repository/src/calculator.html
# 2. Portfolio: file:///path/to/your/repository/src/portfolio.html
# 3. Weather App: file:///path/to/your/repository/src/weather.html

# Make sure all projects work correctly
# Check that all files are properly linked
```

---

## ðŸ§ª Testing Your Merges

### Test 1: File Integration
```bash
# Check that all files are in main
ls src/
# Should show: calculator.html, portfolio.html, weather.html

ls css/
# Should show: style.css, calculator.css, portfolio.css, weather.css
```

### Test 2: Merge History
```bash
# View merge commits
git log --merges --oneline

# Should show your merge commits
```

### Test 3: Branch Cleanup
```bash
# Check local branches
git branch
# Should show only: main

# Check remote branches
git branch -r
# Should show only: origin/main
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

**Your assignment is complete when:**
- âœ… All feature branches are successfully merged
- âœ… Main branch contains all project files
- âœ… All projects work correctly after merging
- âœ… Merged branches are properly cleaned up
- âœ… Repository is organized and clean
- âœ… All changes are pushed to GitHub

## ðŸ”„ Merge Strategies Explained

### 1. **Fast-Forward Merge**
```bash
# When main branch hasn't changed since feature branch was created
# Git simply moves the pointer forward
# No merge commit is created
```

### 2. **Recursive Merge**
```bash
# When main branch has new commits
# Git creates a merge commit
# Combines changes from both branches
# Preserves complete history
```

### 3. **Merge Commit Benefits**
```bash
# Shows when features were integrated
# Preserves branch history
# Makes it easy to understand project evolution
# Helps with debugging and rollbacks
```

---

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Problem: Merge conflicts
```bash
# If you see "CONFLICT" messages:
# 1. Open conflicted files
# 2. Look for conflict markers: <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>
# 3. Resolve conflicts manually
# 4. Add resolved files
# 5. Complete the merge
```

### Problem: Can't delete branches
```bash
# Make sure branches are fully merged
git branch --merged

# Force delete if necessary (be careful!)
git branch -D branch-name
```

### Problem: Remote branches not deleted
```bash
# Check remote branches
git branch -r

# Delete manually if needed
git push origin --delete branch-name
```

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

After completing this assignment:
1. **Review your merge history** on GitHub
2. **Practice merging** with future feature branches
3. **Move to Assignment 5:** Conflict Resolution
