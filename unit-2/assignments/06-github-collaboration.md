echo "        });" >> js.blog.js
echo "    });" >> js.blog.js
echo "    " >> js/blog.js
echo "    // Add animation to blog posts" >> js.blog.js
echo "    const blogPosts = document.querySelectorAll('.blog-post');" >> js.blog.js
echo "    " >> js.blog.js
echo "    blogPosts.forEach((post, index) => {" >> js.blog.js
echo "        post.style.opacity = '0';" >> js.blog.js
echo "        post.style.transform = 'translateY(20px)';" >> js.blog.js
echo "        " >> js.blog.js
