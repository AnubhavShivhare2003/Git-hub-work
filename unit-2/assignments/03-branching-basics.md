## ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

```bash
# Make sure you're in your learning journal repository
cd codinggita-learning-journal

# Check current status
git status

# Should show: "working tree clean"

# Check current branch
git branch --show-current

# Should show: main
```

### Step 2: Create Your First Feature Branch

```bash
# Create and switch to a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/portfolio-website

# Verify you're on the new branch
git branch --show-current

# Should show: feature/portfolio-website

# Check all branches
git branch

# Should show both main and feature/portfolio-website
```

### Step 3: Work on Portfolio Website

```bash
# Create the main portfolio HTML file
echo "<!DOCTYPE html>" > src/portfolio.html
echo "<html lang=\"en\">" >> src/portfolio.html
echo "<head>" >> src/portfolio.html
echo "    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">" >> src/portfolio.html
echo "    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">" >> src/portfolio.html
echo "    <title>My codingGita Portfolio</title>" >> src/portfolio.html
echo "    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"../css/portfolio.css\">" >> src/portfolio.html
echo "</head>" >> src/portfolio.html
echo "<body>" >> src/portfolio.html
echo "    <header>" >> src/portfolio.html
echo "        <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>" >> src/portfolio.html
echo "        <nav>" >> src/portfolio.html
echo "            <ul>" >> src/portfolio.html
echo "                <li><a href=\"#about\">About</a></li>" >> src/portfolio.html
echo "                <li><a href=\"#projects\">Projects</a></li>" >> src/portfolio.html
echo "                <li><a href=\"#contact\">Contact</a></li>" >> src/portfolio.html
echo "            </ul>" >> src/portfolio.html
echo "        </nav>" >> src/portfolio.html
echo "    </header>" >> src/portfolio.html
echo "    <main>" >> src/portfolio.html
echo "        <section id=\"about\">" >> src/portfolio.html
echo "            <h2>About Me</h2>" >> src/portfolio.html
echo "            <p>I'm a first-year student at codingGita College learning web development.</p>" >> src/portfolio.html
echo "        </section>" >> src/portfolio.html
echo "    </main>" >> src/portfolio.html
echo "    <script src=\"../js/portfolio.js\"></script>" >> src/portfolio.html
echo "</body>" >> src/portfolio.html
echo "</html>" >> src/portfolio.html
```

### Step 4: Commit Portfolio Changes

```bash
# Add the portfolio HTML file
git add src/portfolio.html

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: create portfolio website structure

- Add HTML5 boilerplate with semantic elements
- Include navigation menu with anchor links
- Create about section for personal information
- Link to CSS and JavaScript files
- Follow accessibility best practices"
```

### Step 5: Switch to Main Branch

```bash
# Switch back to main branch
git checkout main

# Verify you're on main
git branch --show-current

# Should show: main

# Check what files exist here
ls src/

# Should show: calculator.html (portfolio.html is only in feature branch)
```

### Step 6: Create Another Feature Branch

```bash
# Create a new feature branch for a different project
git checkout -b feature/weather-app

# Verify you're on the new branch
git branch --show-current

# Should show: feature/weather-app

# Check all branches
git branch

# Should show: main, feature/portfolio-website, feature/weather-app
```

### Step 7: Work on Weather App

```bash
# Create the weather app HTML file
echo "<!DOCTYPE html>" > src/weather.html
echo "<html lang=\"en\">" >> src/weather.html
echo "<head>" >> src/weather.html
echo "    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">" >> src/weather.html
echo "    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">" >> src/weather.html
echo "    <title>codingGita Weather App</title>" >> src/weather.html
echo "    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"../css/weather.css\">" >> src/weather.html
echo "</head>" >> src/weather.html
echo "<body>" >> src/weather.html
echo "    <div class=\"weather-container\">" >> src/weather.html
echo "        <h1>Weather App</h1>" >> src/weather.html
echo "        <div class=\"search-box\">" >> src/weather.html
echo "            <input type=\"text\" id=\"city-input\" placeholder=\"Enter city name\">" >> src/weather.html
echo "            <button onclick=\"getWeather()\">Search</button>" >> src/weather.html
echo "        </div>" >> src/weather.html
echo "        <div class=\"weather-info\" id=\"weather-info\">" >> src/weather.html
echo "            <p>Enter a city to see the weather</p>" >> src/weather.html
echo "        </div>" >> src/weather.html
echo "    </div>" >> src/weather.html
echo "    <script src=\"../js/weather.js\"></script>" >> src/weather.html

## ðŸŒ¿ Branch Management Best Practices

### 1. **Naming Conventions**
```bash
# Use descriptive names
feature/user-authentication
feature/calculator-app
feature/portfolio-website

# Avoid generic names
feature/new
feature/stuff
feature/update
```

### 2. **Branch Organization**
```bash
# Keep main branch clean
# Work on features in separate branches
# Use consistent naming patterns
# Delete branches after merging
```

### 3. **Workflow Tips**
```bash
# Always check which branch you're on
git branch --show-current

# Switch branches frequently
git checkout branch-name

# Keep branches focused on single features
# Don't mix different types of work
```

---

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Problem: Can't switch branches
```bash
# Check if you have uncommitted changes
git status

# Commit or stash changes first
git add .
git commit -m "Save work before switching branches"
```

### Problem: Files not showing in branch
```bash
# Make sure you're on the right branch
git branch --show-current

# Check if files were committed
git log --oneline
```

### Problem: Branch not pushing to GitHub
```bash
# Set upstream for new branches
git push -u origin branch-name

# Check remote connections
git remote -v
```
