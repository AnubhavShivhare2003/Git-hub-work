# ⚠️ Resolving Merge Conflicts in Git – CodingGita Hostel Guide

##📌 What is a Merge Conflict?

A merge conflict happens when Git cannot automatically combine changes from two branches because the changes affect the same part of the same file differently.

Think of it like two people editing the same paragraph in a shared Google Doc — when you try to merge their work, you need to decide which changes to keep.

---

## 🛠 When Do Merge Conflicts Happen?

Merge conflicts usually occur when:

- **Merging branches** (`git merge feature-branch`)
- **Pulling changes** from a remote repository (`git pull`)
- **Rebasing branches** (`git rebase main`)
- **Cherry-picking commits** (`git cherry-pick <commit-id>`)

---

## 🔍 Example Scenario (Real-life analogy)

Imagine you and your friend are writing a book.

**You work on a file called `story.txt` in the main branch:**

```
Once upon a time, there was a brave knight.
```

**Your friend works on a branch called `feature` and changes it to:**

```
Once upon a time, there was a clever wizard.
```

Now, when you try to merge `feature` into `main`, Git doesn't know whether the knight or the wizard should be kept — this is a merge conflict.

---

## 📄 How Git Shows a Merge Conflict

When a conflict happens, Git modifies the file like this:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
Once upon a time, there was a brave knight.
=======
Once upon a time, there was a clever wizard.
>>>>>>> feature
```

- **`<<<<<<< HEAD`** → Your current branch's version (main)
- **`=======`** → Separation between the two versions
- **`>>>>>>> feature`** → The incoming branch's version (feature)

---

## 🚀 Steps to Resolve a Merge Conflict

### 1. Check which files have conflicts

```bash
git status
```

**Output example:**
```bash
both modified: story.txt
```

### 2. Open the conflicted file and decide

Manually edit `story.txt` to keep:
- Only one version, or
- A combination of both

**Example (merged version):**
```
Once upon a time, there was a brave knight and a clever wizard.
```

### 3. Mark the conflict as resolved

```bash
git add story.txt
```

### 4. Complete the merge

```bash
git commit
```

---

## 💡 Pro Tip: Abort Merge

If you want to stop the merge process and return to the state before merging:

```bash
git merge --abort
```

---

## 🎯 Real-Life Analogy

Think of Git as a **mediator in a group project**:

1. **You submit your version.**
2. **Your friend submits theirs.**
3. **Git says:** "You both wrote different things in the same spot — please decide which one stays."

## 🏠 Hostel Life Example

**CodingGita Hostel Menu Conflict:**
- **Main branch:** "Monday: Paneer Butter Masala"
- **Feature branch:** "Monday: Paneer Tikka Masala"
- **Conflict:** Both branches changed the same Monday menu item
- **Resolution:** "Monday: Paneer Butter Tikka Masala" (combining both ideas)

## 📚 Summary Table

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `git status` | Shows conflicted files |
| `git merge --abort` | Stops merge and reverts to pre-merge state |
| `git add <file>` | Marks a file as conflict-resolved |
| `git commit` | Finalizes the merge after resolving conflicts |

---

## 🔧 Advanced Conflict Resolution

### Using a Merge Tool
```bash
git mergetool
```
Opens a visual tool to help resolve conflicts.

### Viewing Conflict Markers
```bash
git diff
```
Shows the differences between the conflicted versions.

---

## 💡 Best Practices

1. **Always pull before merging** to minimize conflicts
2. **Use descriptive commit messages** to understand changes
3. **Test your code** after resolving conflicts
4. **Communicate with team members** about conflicting changes

---

## 📝 Summary

- **Merge conflicts** happen when Git can't automatically combine changes
- **Conflict markers** show you exactly where the conflicts are
- **Manual resolution** requires you to decide what to keep
- **Always test** after resolving conflicts
- **Use `git merge --abort`** if you need to start over
