# 📝 Understanding Commits and Commit Messages – CodingGita Hostel Guide

## 📌 What is a Commit in Git?

A **commit** in Git is like saving your progress in a video game — but instead of saving your game level, it saves a **snapshot of your project** at that point in time.

Each commit contains:
- **Changes made** to files
- **Author information** (who made the change)
- **Timestamp** of the commit
- **Commit message** describing the change

💡 **Hostel Life Example:**  
Think of commits like updating your hostel notice board.  
Each time you make a change (e.g., add a new event notice), you **sign your name** and write a note about *what* and *why* you updated.

## 🎯 Why Are Commits Important?

1. **History Tracking:** See exactly what changed and when.
2. **Collaboration:** Know who made specific changes in a group project.
3. **Backups:** Easily revert to older, working versions.
4. **Clarity:** Commit messages explain the purpose of changes.

💡 **Example – CodingGita Hostel App Project**
- Commit 1 → Added Monday breakfast menu.
- Commit 2 → Added lunch menu.
- Commit 3 → Corrected spelling in "Paneer Butter Masala".

If someone mistakenly adds "Pizza" to the breakfast menu 🍕, you can roll back to Commit 2.

## ⚙️ Creating a Commit

A commit has **two main steps**:  
1. **Stage** the changes  
2. **Commit** them with a descriptive message

### Stage Changes
```bash
# Stage a specific file
git add filename.txt

# Stage all changes in the current directory
git add .
```

### Commit Changes
```bash
# Commit with a message
git commit -m "Added Monday breakfast menu for CodingGita hostel"
```

## 🖊 Writing Good Commit Messages

A good commit message makes it easy for you and others to understand the purpose of the commit without looking at the code.

### ✅ Good Messages:
```
Added hostel lunch menu for Tuesday
Fixed login bug in CodingGita app
Updated README with Git setup instructions
```

### ❌ Bad Messages:
```
update
fixed
stuff
```

### 💡 Tips for Writing Good Commit Messages
- Use present tense: "Add" instead of "Added"
- Be specific and describe the change
- Keep it short but clear

---

## 🔍 Viewing Commit History

To see all commits you have made:

```bash
# Full commit history
git log

# Short format (one line per commit)
git log --oneline
```

### Example Output:
```
a3f5d21 Added lunch menu for CodingGita hostel
9b2c7ef Fixed spelling in Paneer Butter Masala
c1d9e34 Added Monday breakfast menu
```
